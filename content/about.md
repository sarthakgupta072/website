# About

I am presently working as a software developer at **Intuit**, where I am working on 
one of their products known as **QuickBooks Desktop Payroll**. It has been a wonderful experience 
working at Intuit till now. :smile:

Other than my day job at Intuit, I am an active contributor in open source. Presently, I am working with
an organization called **[elixir-cloud-aai]("https://elixir-europe.github.io/cloud/")** which comes under the umbrella of organization called **[GA4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org/)**. I was selected in **Google Summer of Code** under this organization and have stayed connected with it till date.
  
I graduated from **Birla Institue of Techniology, Mesra** in the year 2020. Dedicating the next dacade after college life to _learning_ and _implementing_ the things which interests me.

One of the quotes that inspire me a lot is 

“Ideas are cheap. Ideas are easy. Ideas are common. Everybody has ideas. Ideas are highly, highly overvalued. Execution is all that matters.” 

\- Casey Neistat
