# Hey there! Thanks for stopping by!!

I know, you shouldn't believe everything that you see online.  

So, if we ever meet me in person, you'll meet a human being who is extremely curious about many 
different things in life.

Most probably, you would have reached this page, because you might have heard my name is some field related to software development. Well, that is my passion ofcourse, but there are many other things that like doing.

The two thoughts which drive my life are are **Regret Minimization Framework** and **Trusting the Process**.

I blog sometimes on medium.com, which can be found [here](https://medium.com/sophozaar).

If you are someone who want to know more about me and some of my achievements then click [here](/about).
